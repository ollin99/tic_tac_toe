School project for a course where I had to make a webbsite with atleast html and php.
I choose to make a tic-tac-toe game.
To start this proejct oyu have to have the application XAMPP and start APACHE and MySQL.
I made a database to this project, for keeping track of users and the state of the game
It was created in phpMyAdmin
My database is called tic_tac_toe_db, with two tables games and players.
Players has the columns player_id and player_name
Games has the columns game_id, player_x, player_o, board_state, current_player and winner
